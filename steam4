    			<p> It has long been theorized that the week prior to an exam is an extremely dangerous time for the relatives of college students. Ever since I began my teaching career, I heard vague comments, incomplete references and unfinished remarks, all alluding to the "Dead Grandmother Problem."</p>
			    <p>Few colleagues would ever be explicit in their description of what they knew, but I quickly discovered that anyone who was involved in teaching at the college level would react to any mention of the concept. In my travels I found that a similar phenomenon is known in other countries. In England it is called the "Graveyard Grannies'' problem, in France the "Chere Grand'mere," while in Bulgaria it is inexplicably known as "The Toadstool Waxing Plan" (I may have had some problems here with the translation. Since the revolution this may have changed anyway.) Although the problem may be international in scope it is here in the USA that it reaches its culmination, so it is only fitting that the first warnings emanate here also.</p>

				<h1>About RISD STEAM</h1>
                    RISD STEAM is a student-run organization that aims to engage students with the rising push to include art and design thinking into the traditional "STEM" model of education. By turning STEM into STEAM, the club strives to foster a new kind of learning, promoting high-level, transformative thinking among the next generation of leaders and innovators. The club encourages students to investigate the principles of STEAM in their own work, by hosting events and building networks within the Providence community and with students from neighboring institutions such as Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br /><br />
