RISD STEAM is a student group at the <a href="http://risd.edu">Rhode Island School of Design</a> which aims to engage students with the rising push to include art and design thinking into the traditional "STEM" model of education. By turning STEM into STEAM, the club strives to foster a new kind of learning, promoting high-level, creative thinking among the next generation of leaders and innovators. We encourage students to investigate what STEAM might mean to them regardless of their field of study. We do this through hosting events that are workshops, lectures, and discussions. We also work to build networks within the Providence community and with students from neighboring institutions such as Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We invite everyone to become a part of STEAM groups! We Â are equally interested in what every differing perspective might bring to our community.
